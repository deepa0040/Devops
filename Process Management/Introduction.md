Process managers are essential tools in DevOps for automating the lifecycle management of applications. A process manager is a crucial tool for automating the deployment, management, and monitoring of applications, especially in production environments.  It ensures that applications run reliably and consistently, even in the face of unexpected issues or system restarts.

It ensures:
-  make sure our application keeps running ( application/website stay online). **(Keep apps running)**
-  If an application crashes, the process manager automatically restarts it, so you don't have to do it manually.  **(Auto-restart)**
-  They keep an eye on your apps, checking for things like high CPU usage or memory leaks.  **(Watch for problems)**
-  They help manage application logs, so you can easily see what's happening with your apps and find any errors. **(Log everything)**
-  Some process managers help you update your apps without any downtime (zero-downtime deployments). **(Make updates easy)**
-  They can automatically start your apps when the server restarts.  **(Start apps on boot:)**
-  They can handle multiple apps running on the same server, making sure they all have the resources they need. **(Manage many apps)**
-  Basically, they automate a lot of the boring and repetitive tasks of managing applications, so DevOps engineers can focus on other things.  **(Manage many apps)**
-  Process managers are a must-have for running apps reliably in a real-world (production) environment.  **(Essential for production)**


Example:

PM2 (Node.js): A popular choice for managing Node.js applications.
Systemd (Linux): A system and service manager built into most modern Linux distributions.
